## The Game

Yahtzee is a chance-and-strategy dice rolling game. A game is played over 13 rounds.

Each round, the player rolls five 6-sided dice. They may click on any number of dice to “freeze” or “unfreeze” them (frozen dice are colored darker). They may re-roll the unfrozen dice up to 2 times.

Each round, they must assign their dice to any unclaimed scoring category. Each category scores differently.

After 13 rounds, the game is over, and the player’s score is the total of each scoring category.
